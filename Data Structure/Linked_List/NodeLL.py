    Simplest Method (Insert new node by placing it at the head of the list and point new node at the old head 
    (Note: Sort of pushing the other node down the line, As for Time Complexity, this implementation of insert is constant O(1)
    This is because the insert method, no matter what, will always take the same amount of time: it can only take one data point,
    it can only ever create one node, and the new node doesnâ€™t need to interact with all the other nodes in the list, the inserted
    node will only ever interact with the head.)
